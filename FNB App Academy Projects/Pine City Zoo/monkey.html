                <h3>MONKEYS</h3>
            <p>Monkey is a common name that may refer to most mammals of the infraorder Simiiformes, also known as simians.
            Traditionally, all animals in the group now known as simians are counted as monkeys except the apes. Thus monkeys, in
            that sense, constitute an incomplete paraphyletic grouping; alternatively, if apes (Hominoidea) are included, monkeys
            and simians are synonyms.</p>
            <p>Many monkey species are tree-dwelling (arboreal), although there are species that live primarily on the ground, such as
            baboons. Most species are mainly active during the day (diurnal). Monkeys are generally considered to be intelligent,
            especially the Old World monkeys.</p>
            <p>Lemurs, lorises, and galagos are not monkeys, but strepsirrhine primates (suborder Strepsirrhini). The simians' sister
            group, the tarsiers, are also haplorhine primates; however, they are also not monkeys.[citation needed]</p>
            <p>Apes emerged within monkeys as sister of the Cercopithecidae in the Catarrhini, so cladistically they are monkeys as
            well. However, there has been resistance to directly designate apes (and thus humans) as monkeys, so "Old World monkey"
            may be taken to mean either the Cercopithecoidea (not including apes) or the Catarrhini (including
            apes).[17][18][19][20][21][22][23][24][25] That apes are monkeys was already realized by Georges-Louis Leclerc, Comte de
            Buffon in the 18th century.[26] Linnaeus placed this group in 1758 together with the tarsiers, in a single genus "Simia"
            (sans Homo), an ensemble now recognised as the Haplorhini.[27]</p>
            <p>Monkeys, including apes, can be distinguished from other primates by having only two pectoral nipples, a pendulous
            penis, and a lack of sensory whiskers.</p>
